For now, a simple api proxy server, compelte with unit tests that leverage nock to provide mock or stubbed API responses.  Hopefully one day a unified RESTful API gateway or API proxy server written in Node.js, designed to facilitate seamless communication between various APIs, including but not limited to OASIS API in C# and SOLID APIs.

Use ```npm test``` to run the jest unit tests.
